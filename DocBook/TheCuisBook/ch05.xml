<para>Cuis-Smalltalk syntax is minimal. Essentially there is syntax only for
sending messages (i.e., expressions) . Expressions are built up from a
very small number of primitive elements. There are only 6 keywords,
and <emphasis role="bold">there is no syntax for control structures</emphasis> or for
declaring new classes. Instead, nearly everything is achieved by
sending messages to objects. For instance, instead of an if-then-else
control structure, Smalltalk sends messages like <literal>#ifTrue:</literal> to
<literal>Boolean</literal> objects. As we already know, new (sub)classes are
created by sending a message to their superclass.

<para><literal>nil</literal>, <literal>true</literal>, <literal>false</literal>,
<literal>self</literal>, <literal>super</literal>, and <literal>thisContext</literal>.
</para>
<para>They are called <firstterm>pseudo-variables</firstterm> because they are predefined and

   of interest to most programmers, but it is essential for
   implementing development tools like the Debugger and it is also

<sect1 label="" id="Method-syntax">
<title>Method syntax</title>
<indexterm role="cp"><primary>method</primary></indexterm>

<para>Whereas expressions may be evaluated anywhere in Cuis-Smalltalk (for example 
in a workspace, in a debugger, or in a browser), methods are normally
defined in the System Browser window or in the Debugger. Methods can
also be filed in from an external medium, but this is not the usual
way to program in Cuis-Smalltalk.
</para>
<para>Programs are developed one method at a time, in the context of a given
class. A class is defined by sending a message to an existing class,
asking it to create a subclass, so there is no special syntax required
for defining classes. We are already farmiliar with this
from previous examples.
</para>
<para>Let&#8217;s take a another look to the method syntax when control flow is
involved &#8211; our first explanation was <link linkend="Spacewar_0021-States-and-Behaviors">Spacewar! States and Behaviors</link>).
</para>
<para>Here is the method <literal>keyStroke:</literal> in the class <literal>SpaceWar</literal>.
</para>
<anchor id="spacewarKeyStroke"/>
<screen>SpaceWar&gt;&gt;keyStroke: event
&quot;Check for any keyboard stroke&#44; and take action accordingly&quot;
   | key |
   key := event keyCharacter.
   event isArrowUp ifTrue: [^ ships first push].
   event isArrowRight ifTrue: [^ ships first right].
   event isArrowLeft ifTrue: [^ ships first left].
   event isArrowDown ifTrue: [^ ships first fireTorpedo].
   key = $w ifTrue: [^ ships second push].
   ...
</screen>

<para>Syntactically, a method consists of:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>the method pattern, containing the name (<emphasis>i.e.</emphasis>,
 <literal>keyStroke:</literal>) and any arguments. Here <literal>event</literal> is a
 <literal>KeyboardEvent</literal>,
</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>comments (these may occur anywhere, but the convention is to
 put one at the top that explains what the method does),
</para> 
</listitem><listitem><para>declarations of local variables (<emphasis>i.e.</emphasis>, <literal>key</literal>),
</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>and any number of expressions separated by dots; here there are
 5.
</para>
</listitem></itemizedlist>
<para>The evaluation of any expression preceded by a ^ (typed as ^)
will cause the method to exit at that point, returning the value of
that expression. A method that terminates without explicitly returning
the value of some expression will always return the current
value of <literal>self</literal>.
</para>
<para>Arguments and local variables should always start with lower case
letters. Names starting with upper-case letters are assumed to be
global variables. Class names, like <literal>Character</literal>, for example,
are simply global variables referring to the object representing
that class.
</para>
<para>As you might suspect from <link linkend="classesCount">classesCount</link>, <literal>Smalltalk allClasses size</literal> just
sends the <literal>#allClasses</literal> message to a dictionary named <literal>Smalltalk</literal>.
As with any other object, you can inspect this dictionary.  You can note a case of
self-reference here: the value of <literal>Smalltalk at: #Smalltalk</literal> is <literal>Smalltalk</literal>.
</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 label="" id="Block-syntax">
<title>Block syntax</title>
<indexterm role="cp"><primary>block</primary></indexterm>

<para>Blocks provide a mechanism to defer the evaluation of expressions. A
block is essentially an anonymous function. A block is evaluated by
sending it the message <literal>#value</literal>. The block answers the value of the
last expression in its body, unless there is an explicit return (with
^), in which case it returns the value of the subsequent
expression).
</para>
<screen>[ 1 + 2 ] value
&#8658; 3
</screen>
<indexterm role="cp"><primary>block</primary><secondary>parameter</secondary></indexterm><para>Blocks may take parameters, each of which is declared with a leading
colon. A vertical bar separates the parameter declaration(s) from the
body of the block. To evaluate a block with one parameter, you must
send it the message <literal>#value:</literal> with one argument. A two-parameter
block must be sent <literal>#value:value:</literal>, and so on, up to 4 arguments:
</para>
<screen>[ :x | 1 + x ] value: 2
&#8658; 3
[ :x :y | x + y ] value: 1 value: 2
&#8658; 3
</screen>
<para>If you have a block with more than four parameters, you must use
<literal>#valueWithArguments:</literal> and pass the arguments in an array. (A block
with a large number of parameters is often a sign of a design
problem.)
</para>
<indexterm role="cp"><primary>block</primary><secondary>local variable</secondary></indexterm><para>Blocks may also declare local variables, which are surrounded by
vertical bars, just like local variable declarations in a
method. Locals are declared after any arguments:
</para>
<screen>[ :x :y | | z | z := x + y. z ] value: 1 value: 2
&#8658; 3
</screen>
<para>Blocks can refer to
variables of the surrounding environment.
Blocks are said to &#8220;close over&#8221; their lexical environment, which
is a fancy way to say that they remember and refer to variables in
their surrounding lexical context &#8211; those apparent in their enclosing text.
</para>
<para>The following block refers
to the variable x of its enclosing environment:
</para>
<screen>|x|
x := 1.
[ :y | x + y ] value: 2
&#8658; 3
</screen>
<indexterm role="cp"><primary>block</primary><secondary>assigned to a variable</secondary></indexterm><para>Blocks are instances of the class <literal>BlockClosure</literal>. This means
that they are objects, so they can be assigned to variables and passed
as arguments just like any other object.
</para>
<para>Consider the example below to compute the divisors of an integer:
</para>
<anchor id="computeDivisors"/>
<screen>| n m |
n := 60.
m := 45.
(1 to: n) select: [:d | n \\ d = 0 ].
&quot;&#8658; #(1 2 3 4 5 6 10 12 15 20 30 60)&quot;
(1 to: m) select: [:d | m \\ d = 0]
&quot;&#8658; #(1 3 5 9 15 45)&quot;
</screen>

<para>The problem with this example is the code duplication in the divisor
computation. We can avoid duplication with a dedicated block doing the
computation and assigning it to a variable:
</para>
<anchor id="blockDivisor"/>

<title>Control flow with block and message</title>
<indexterm role="cp"><primary>control flow</primary></indexterm>

<para>Deciding to send <emphasis>this</emphasis> message instead of <emphasis>that</emphasis>
one is called <firstterm>control flow</firstterm> &#8211;
controlling the flow of a computation.
Smalltalk offers no special constructs for control flow.
Decision logic is expressed by sending messages to booleans, numbers
and collections with blocks as arguments.
</para>

<indexterm role="cp"><primary>control flow</primary><secondary>test</secondary></indexterm><indexterm role="cp"><primary>test</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm role="cp"><primary>boolean</primary></indexterm>

<para>Conditionals are expressed by sending one of the messages
<literal>#ifTrue:</literal>, <literal>#ifFalse:</literal> or <literal>#ifTrue:ifFalse:</literal> to the result
of a boolean expression:
</para>
<screen>(17 * 13 &gt; 220)
  ifTrue: [ 'bigger' ]
  ifFalse: [ 'smaller' ]
&#8658; 'bigger'
</screen>
<para>The class <literal>Boolean</literal> offers a fascinating insight into how much
of the Smalltalk language has been pushed into the class
library. <literal>Boolean</literal> is the abstract superclass of the
<emphasis>Singleton</emphasis> classes <literal>True</literal> and <literal>False</literal><footnote><para>A
singleton class is designed to have only one instance. Each of
<literal>True</literal> and <literal>False</literal> classes has one instance, the values 
<literal>true</literal> and <literal>false</literal>.</para></footnote>.
</para>
<para>Most of the behaviour of <literal>Boolean</literal> instances can be understood
by considering the method <literal>ifTrue:ifFalse:</literal>, which takes two
blocks as arguments:
</para>
<screen>(4 factorial &gt; 20) ifTrue: [ 'bigger' ] ifFalse: [ 'smaller' ]
&#8658; 'bigger'
</screen>
<para>The method is abstract in <literal>Boolean</literal>. It is implemented in its
concrete subclasses <literal>True</literal> and <literal>False</literal>:
</para>
<anchor id="ifTrueIfFalse"/>
<screen>True&gt;&gt;ifTrue: trueAlternativeBlock ifFalse: falseAlternativeBlock
  ^ trueAlternativeBlock value

False&gt;&gt;ifTrue: trueAlternativeBlock ifFalse: falseAlternativeBlock
  ^ falseAlternativeBlock value
</screen>

<para>In fact, this is the essence of OOP: when a message is sent to an
object, the object itself determines which method will be used to
respond. In this case an instance of True simply evaluates the true
alternative, while an instance of False evaluates the false
alternative. All the abstract <literal>Boolean</literal> methods are implemented
in this way for <literal>True</literal> and <literal>False</literal>. Look at another
example:
</para>
<anchor id="negation"/>
<screen>True&gt;&gt;not
   &quot;Negation----answer false since the receiver is true.&quot;
   ^ false
</screen>

<para>Booleans offer several useful convenience methods, such as
<literal>ifTrue:</literal>, <literal>ifFalse:</literal>, <literal>ifFalse:ifTrue:</literal>. You also
have the choice between eager and lazy conjunctions and disjunctions:
</para>
<screen>(1 &gt; 2) &amp; (3 &lt; 4)
&#8658; false  &quot;must evaluate both sides&quot;
(1 &gt; 2) and: [ 3 &lt; 4 ]
&#8658; false  &quot;only evaluate receiver&quot;
(1 &gt; 2) and: [ (1 / 0) &gt; 0 ]
&#8658; false  &quot;argument block is never evaluated, so no exception&quot;
</screen>
<para>In the first example, both <literal>Boolean</literal> subexpressions are
evaluated, since <literal>&amp;</literal> takes a <literal>Boolean</literal> argument. In
the second and third examples, only the first is evaluated, since
<literal>and:</literal> expects a <literal>Block</literal> as its argument. The
<literal>Block</literal> is evaluated only if the first argument is true.
</para>
<anchor id="implementingAndOr"/>
<para><emphasis>Try to imagine how <literal>and:</literal> and <literal>or:</literal> are  implemented.</emphasis>
</para>


<para>In the <link linkend="spacewarKeyStroke">spacewarKeyStroke</link> at the beginning of this chapter, there
are 4 control flow <literal>#ifTrue:</literal> messages. Each argument is a block of
code and when evaluated, it explicitly returns an expression,
therefore interrupting the method execution.
</para>
<para>In the code fragment of <link linkend="shipLost">shipLost</link> below, we test if a ship is
lost in deep space. It depends on two conditions:
</para><orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem><para>the ship is out of the game play area, tested with the
  <literal>#isInOuterSpace</literal> message,
</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>the ship takes the direction of deep space, tested with the
  <literal>#isGoingOuterSpace</literal> message.
</para>
</listitem></orderedlist>
<para>Of course, the condition #2 is only tested when condition #1 is true.
</para>
<anchor id="shipLost"/>
<screen>&quot;Are we out of screen?
If so we move the mobile to the other corner
and slow it down by a factor of 2&quot;
(self isInOuterSpace and: [self isGoingOuterSpace])
  ifTrue: [
     velocity := velocity / 2.
     self morphPosition: self morphPosition negated]
</screen>


<bridgehead renderas="sect2">Loop</bridgehead>
<indexterm role="cp"><primary>control flow</primary><secondary>loop</secondary></indexterm><indexterm role="cp"><primary>loop</primary></indexterm>

<para>Loops are typically expressed by sending messages to blocks, integers
or collections. Since the exit condition for a loop may be repeatedly
evaluated, it should be a block rather than a boolean value. Here is
an example of a very procedural loop:
</para>
<screen>n := 1.
[ n &lt; 1000 ] whileTrue: [ n := n * 2 ].
n &#8658; 1024
</screen>
<para><literal>#whileFalse:</literal> reverses the exit condition:
</para>
<screen>n := 1.
[ n &gt; 1000 ] whileFalse: [ n := n * 2 ].
n &#8658; 1024
</screen>
<para>You can check all the alternatives in the <command>controlling</command> method
category of the class <literal>BlockClosure</literal>.
</para>
<para><literal>#timesRepeat:</literal> offers a simple way to implement a fixed iteration:
</para>
<screen>n := 1.
10 timesRepeat: [ n := n * 2 ].
n &#8658; 1024
</screen>
<para>We can also send the message <literal>#to:do:</literal> to a number which then acts
as the initial value of a loop counter. The two arguments are the
upper bound, and a block that takes the current value of the loop
counter as its argument:
</para>
<screen>result := String new.
1 to: 10 do: [:n | result := result, n printString, ' '].
result &#8658; '1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 '
</screen>
<para>You can check all the alternatives in the <command>intervals</command> method
category of the class <literal>Number</literal>.
</para>
<para>&#160;<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="note.png" format="PNG"></imagedata></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>
If the exit condition of method like <literal>whileTrue:</literal> is
never satisfied, you may have implemented an <firstterm>infinite loop</firstterm>.
