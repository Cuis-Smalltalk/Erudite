<!-- We should write Cuis is easily discoverable, one can learn by looking at Cuis code -->

<para>Cuis-Smalltalk &#8212;in short, Cuis&#8212; is a portable environment for doing,
building and sharing software. Like any other tool, Cuis doesn&#8217;t
require having a particular mindset or following a particular
process. However, Cuis is built with a specific view on what software
is, and what it means to build software. As a consequence, Cuis is
especially effective if these ideas resonate with you and, at least
occasionally, you let them guide your thoughts and actions.
</para>
<para>In this book, we will accompany you as you explore, discover and
learn about Cuis and Smalltalk.
</para>
<para>We don&#8217;t assume knowledge of computer programming, but if you happen
to have some experience with an Object-Oriented or Functional language
you will recognize many concepts. If you don&#8217;t have any programming
experience or you have coded in an imperative, closer to the metal
language, such as C or Assembly, many of the ideas may be new.
</para>
<para>In any case, especially during the first chapters, read this book and
follow the examples with an open mind. A new point of view on what
software development means will be an enriching experience.  For us,
programming is a thoughtful process.
</para>
<para>We understand software development as the activity of learning and
documenting knowledge for ourselves and others to use, and also to be
run on a computer. The fact that a computer can execute the software
and produce useful solutions to some problems is a consequence of the
knowledge being sound and relevant. Just making it work is not the
important part!
</para>
<para>These ideas strongly shape Cuis and the experience of using it, and
we&#8217;ll develop them further along in this book.  Amongst their most
obvious consequences are a passion for reducing unneeded complexity,
while providing a complete, live software development experience.
</para>
<para>This book is an introduction and invitation to explore Cuis.  We hope
you will join us in this journey to use it as a medium to express
ideas and thoughts, to build cool stuff, and to make Cuis even better.

project is its recurring theme. It is distilled into the book in code
examples, exercises and dedicated chapters. At the end of the book,
you will have written a replica of this historic video game. The final
Cuis-Smalltalk package of this game can be downloaded from the book

<para>The reader can study Cuis-Smalltalk from two versions of the book:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Online.</emphasis> With a web browser at the
 <ulink url="https://cuis-smalltalk.github.io/TheCuisBook">https://cuis-smalltalk.github.io/TheCuisBook</ulink> address. The book
 is structured in chapters and sections, displayed one at a time. It
 is a very flexible way to study the book: you can open several
 chapters and appendices on different tabs in your web browser. It
 requires you to be connected to the Internet, though.
</para>
</listitem><listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Offline.</emphasis> In a single PDF file you download and read
 offline. It can be printed as a nice paper book. The most recent
 build can be found at <ulink url="https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/TheCuisBook">https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/TheCuisBook</ulink>.
</para>
</listitem></itemizedlist>
<indexterm role="cp"><primary>returned value</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm role="cp"><primary>variable</primary><secondary>assignment</secondary></indexterm><indexterm role="cp"><primary>assignment</primary><see>variable</see></indexterm>

<para>The chapters come with many examples. Some can be copied and pasted into
Cuis-Smalltalk. We encourage you to do this, and in the process modify them
to explore on your own.
</para>
<para>The code examples in the online version can be directly copied and
pasted into Cuis-Smalltalk. This is why the assignment character &#8220;&#x2190;&#8221;
you see in the developer Cuis-Smalltalk window is printed as &#8220;:=&#8221; in the
online version of the book. The same applies to the return character
&#8220;&#x2191;&#8221; printed as &#8220;^&#8221; in the online version.
</para>
<para>In the offline PDF version, the code examples are printed with the same
assignment and return characters as seen in the Cuis-Smalltalk windows. Copying
and pasting also work as expected.
</para>
<para>Other examples are code extracts which are not self-sufficient to be
executed as is. Their purpose is to expose specific facets of the Smalltalk
language.
</para>
<para>A typical example without a caption looks like:
</para>
<screen>100 factorial
</screen>
<para>The same example with a caption appears with a number and title, and
can be used as a reference elsewhere in the book:
</para>
<anchor id="exampleExample"/>
<screen>100 factorial
&#8658;  9332621544394415268169923885626670049071596826438162146859

</screen>

<para>There are also a lot of exercises. Most are very easy; they intend to give you
an opportunity to apply what you have just learned.
</para>
<para>Exercises are easily identified by the Cuis-Smalltalk mascot: <firstterm>Cuis</firstterm>,
a South American rodent!
